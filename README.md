# Welcome to my first Data Structures Project In Java
This is a large collection of datastructures designed from scratch in Java. 
Note that all the structures created are customised to fit the purpose of serving the **Waffles** web application.

## What is **Waffles** ?
A Trip Advisor rip-off packed with more than 20,000 entries of restaurants and users.

## Data Structures
All the Data Structures Created are located in the 	**structures** directory.

## Types:
- Stack
- Queue
- List
- Doubly Linked List
- Sorted Linked List
- HashMap
- Binary Tree
- AVL Tree
- Multidimentional AVL Tree

## Achievements
This project serves as a testament to my expertise in crafting robust data structures and applying them to tackle real-world challenges. While the ultimate goal was to deliver the most optimal solution, certain time constraints meant we couldn't reach that pinnacle.

Nonetheless, I did accomplish something noteworthy. I successfully designed and implemented an array of data structures, including more intricate ones. What sets my work apart is the incorporation of custom functions that underscore my proficiency in harnessing the full potential of these data structures.
